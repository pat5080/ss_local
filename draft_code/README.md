# ss_local

This is a package that Patrick Korczak wrote. It subscribes to various ROS topics published by a Hark Node and by
the ORB_SLAM2 ROS package within ORB-SLAM2. Code within the ORB-SLAM2 package must be modified in order to publish 
data from the ORB-SLAM2 framework. Patrick Korczak does not provide a modified version of ORB-SLAM2. This package was
written during the planning phase of the project and may need further testing for robustness. Feel free to become familiar with
the code and modify it.
